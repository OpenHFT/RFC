== Goals

SPB is designed to be a portable wire-framing format for opaque blobs of data carried over streaming protocols such as TCP/IP.

This format is intend to be used for streaming data such as TCP connections and streaming files.

== Format description

The file or TCP connection starts with a header.This header is an object which controls how to handle the remaining content of the file.
This first 4 bytes are the Size Prefixed (See blow) followed by the content of the header.The header is typically meta data.

After the header, a series of messages are prefixed by a 32-bit value which contains a 31-bit size.

A length 32-bit word of 0x00000000 is defined as unset or invalid.To send a zero length message it must be a meta data message of 0 length.

== Message length

The length **includes the 4 byte header** This means a length of 0 is invalid, and lengths of 1, 2, 3 are reserved for future use.

Negative lengths (with a high bit set) are also reserved for future use.

This means the longest message supported without a header is 2147483643 bytes (2^31-5)

NOTE: A length of 0 is chosen to be invalid to avoid accepting random data (which is most likely 0) as a header.

== Empty message

.To send an empty message, send a length of 4
----
0x04 00 00 00
----

== Message with 4 bytes

.To send a message with 4 bytes of data, send a length of 8
----
0x08 00 00 00 01 02 03 04
