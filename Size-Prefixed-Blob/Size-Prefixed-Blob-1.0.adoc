== Goals

SPB is designed to be a portable wire-framing format for opaque blobs of data carried over streaming protocols such as TCP/IP.

This format is intend to be used for streaming data such as TCP connections and streaming files.

== Format description

The file or TCP connection starts with a header.This header is an object which controls how to handle the remaining content of the file.This first 4 bytes are the Size Prefixed (See blow) followed by the content of the header.The header is typically meta data.

After the header, a series of messages are prefixed by a 32-bit value which contains a 30-bit size and two bits used to make parsing the stream easier.

A length 32-bit word of 0x00000000 is defined as unset or invalid.To send a zero length message it must be a meta data message of 0 length.

== File Format bits

In file format;

- the bit 31 indicates whether the current size is ready, 0 = ready, 1 = not ready.
- the bit 30 indicates the message contains meta data. 0 = user data, 1 = meta data,

== Empty message

.To send an empty message, send a zero length, ready, meta data message
----
0x40000000
----

== End of stream or file message

.To mark a stream as ended, set a zero length meta-data, not ready, meta data message
----
0xC0000000
----

=== Documentation of message headers

For illustration in documentation and based on how http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html[YAML 1.2] represents the start of a message, this header can be described in terms of the directive

The following block is meta-data (See the ABNF section)

[source,yaml]
----
--- !!meta-data
----

The following block is not-ready-meta-data (See the ABNF section)

[source,yaml]
----
--- !!not-ready-meta-data
----

The following block is data (See the ABNF section)

[source,yaml]
----
--- !!data
----

The following block is not-ready-data (See the ABNF section)

[source,yaml]
----
--- !!not-ready-data

=== handling of incomplete messages in files.

A message can start with either a known (length > 0) or unknown length (length == 0)

- `0b0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` - no message is ready yet.This is useful in zero padded files.
- `0b0MXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX` - a messages is ready, if M == 1, this is a meta-data message.
- `0b1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` - the length is not yet known.
- `0b1100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000` - the end of the stream has been reached.
- `0b1MXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX` - the message is not complete, however the length is known.

=== handling of messages in a TCP stream

A message must always with written with a known length.The not-ready flag can be used to inidicate whether there is any more data for the -sub-stream in the TCP connections.

- `0b00XX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX` - a user driven messages, this is the last message for this transmission.
- `0b01XX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX` - a session message such as where to send the next user driven message.
- `0b10XX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX` - a user driven message is available, however more messages can be expected for this transmission.

== Allocation and update lifecycle.

==== Writing a blob to a file

When appending a new entry, a writer must first find free space.
It can scan the file, examining the length of each record until it finds a 0x00000000 32-bit value, using a CAS (Compare-And-Swap) to reserve the use space.

The writer can use two approaches.
- write the known length with the not ready flag set.In this case, a concurrent writer can skip to the end and try again.
- write a length of 0 with the not ready flag set.In this case, a concurrent writer must wait until the length is known.

After putting a place holder at the start of a blob, it can write the blob.
Once it is finished it can go back and put the known length and clear the not ready flag.

=== Reading a blob from a file.

When reading a blob, the reader can check the first 32-bit for the length.The reader can either;

- read every blob, waiting for it to be ready before reading.
- read only meta-data or only non-meta data blobs.This reader can skip blobs it is not reading even if the blob is not ready (provided the length is known)

== TCP Connection Format bit

In a TCP socket connection;

- the bit 31 indicates whether there is more data, 0 = no more data for this action, 1 = more data needs to be read.
- the bit 30 indicates the message contains meta data. 0 = user data, 1 = meta data.

== Message length

The message length is a 30-bit unsigned length from 1 to 2^30^-1 bytes.
