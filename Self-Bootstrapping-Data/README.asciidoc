== Goals
Data Bootstrap describes how a file or TCP data stream can bootstrap itself.

The header of a master file or start of a stream has a message containing a serializable object.  This object is deserialized and operation of the stream or files or directory is delegated to this deserialized object.

For rewritable media such as files, the deserialized object can retain a reference to the location of the source of the data and alter it in place.
