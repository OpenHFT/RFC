== Goals
RFC on how URI should be used in services.

As well as using URI's to uniquely identify a service, a context for URI can be used to specify relative URIs.

== Unique resource identifier
All resource map to a URI.  This URI can be used to access any service if known.

== Relative URI.
When referring service, a relative URI can be used.  This will be relative to a service path to search for a service.

If a service URI starts with a word and does not contain a colon it can form a relative address of a context path. e.g. If the context path is

```
csp://host1:9876/dir/
tcp://host2:58796/services/
```
and the resource is specified as `group/service-name`, the resulting search path will be

```
csp://host1:9876/dir/group/service-name
tcp://host2:58796/services/group/service-name
```

=== Lenient format.
To support embedding the URI in a YAML style message, an optional space is allowed after the first colon.

```
csp: //host1:9876/dir/group/service-name
tcp: //host2:58796/services/group/service-name
```
The space should be ignored and can be dropped.

=== Future use
In the future, use of the `user-name@`, `?query` and `#fragment` notation may be used.
