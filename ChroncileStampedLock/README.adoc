# Goals
An RFC which embraces the need for a JEP-383 savvy equivalent of the j.u.c.l.StampedLock API.
A new ChronicleStampedLock capability will greatly empower capital markets
Java technologists to (on HPC platforms like
www.xsede.org, with zero gc) render
and aggregate
quantitative RISK metrics (for
optimistic and intolerant strategies).
